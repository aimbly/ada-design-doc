## Introduction

[**ADA Design**](https://aimbly.github.io/ada-design-doc/) is a React UI kit for building incredible products for awesome communities on the web, providing an immersive experience for developers that aims to develop a fully accessible application.

It's built and maintained open-source by [**Aimbly**](https://github.com/Aimbly).

## Core Pillars

ADA Design is being built taking into accountancy some core pillars we believe are essential for a successful library.

### Flexibility

We are aware that there're already several libraries available on NPM that provide awesome features and impeccable designs - _and we need to be honest in saying that they're doing an awesome job with them_ - but we wanted to go a little bit further with it. We wanted to create a UI kit that mixes all the awesome components/designs present on these libraries but also with all the power that an accessibility lint can provide you - and, what's best, everything fully interactive with your UI.

Using [**ADA Design**](https://aimbly.github.io/ada-design-doc/), you are going to be able to take the advantage of several UI components already built-in in the library that aims to allow us to **build your pages faster** and **improve the ADA score of it**. And, if you want to use your own component or some others provided by another library, there is no problem -- You can take advantage of our **interactive accessibility analyses even with components that were not built by us**.

### Design focused but no limits

We know that when we're trying to build websites quickly, it's pretty useful to use all the components already built-in in the library and take advantage of its design. So, thinking about this, one of our core beliefs is that we need to be **design-focused**. So you can expect us to provide components with better design quality.

On the other hand, we also know that for larger projects we're tended to use custom designs. Using [**ADA Design**](https://aimbly.github.io/ada-design-doc/) we won't face any limitations regarding it. We provide you an awesome design that you can use but you have all the **freedom to customize it** and use it the way you believe that's better for your project.

[**ADA Design**](https://aimbly.github.io/ada-design-doc/) is built on the belief that using Evergreen and contributing to [**ADA Design**](https://aimbly.github.io/ada-design-doc/) should be a **pleasant experience**. We prioritize documentation and all the tools for a solid developer experience.
